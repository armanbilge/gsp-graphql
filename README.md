# Grackle

## Overview

* Grackle is a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) server implementation for [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org).
* Grackle is powered by [cats](http://typelevel.org/cats/), [cats-effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/), and
  [circe](https://circe.github.io/circe/).
* Grackle embraces the [Scala Code of Conduct](http://scala-lang.org/conduct.html).
* **Grackle is pre-release software!** Code and documentation are under active development!

## How to Learn

There is a work-in-progress microsite which contains a tutorial walkthrough of the included demo project. This hasn't
found a permanent home yet, and for now can most easily be accessed by running,

```
sbt docs/tlSitePreview
```

and then browsing to [localhost:4242](http://localhost:4242).
